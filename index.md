### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites since it was my first exposure to the if-else statements. For such a simple game of guessing a number and then telling the user if the guess was too high or too low involved so many if statement. It was also where I was made aware that I could end the function early by placing a return statement at that part of the code which was written for when the user guessed the number on their first attempt.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because it was where I was exposed to vectors as well as how I could call up specific parts of the arguments provided. I especially found the bool functions to be the most interesting part for the fact that I had always thought codes were written in one big block rather than being able to be split up into seperate smaller functions which could be called upon like the IsCardName() function which combine if statements and 3 other bool functions to determine if the arguments were truly cards.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 1 was a favorite of mine due to the fact that it was where I first utilized a loop inside of another. Additionally, I found it interesting that patterns could be created with the loops to showcase the way each loop could utilize the same int variable and the contents inside of that specific loop will utilzed inside that loop. Additionally, the display of how the dashes, bars, and line number changes made me finally realize how many loops there are depending upon if I start at a specific number and end up with less than or using equal to to gain an extra loop.
